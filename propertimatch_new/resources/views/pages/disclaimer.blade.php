These countries may not have similar data protection  laws to those that apply in your country. </p>
    <p>We do not  knowingly collect or process data from anyone under the age of eighteen (18)  years old. </p>
    <p>Match Property Direct  Group sites may also use Google Analytics to gather statistics on site usage.  This may involve the use of cookies. There are more details in our Cookie  Notice and in Google's own privacy policy.

    <h3>The information we gather</h3>
    <p>
    At various  times you may give your personal data to us. For example, in order to send a  request or inquiry from you to a property owner or manager, we may need to know  all or some of the following: your full name, address, telephone  number, e-mail address, your current location, and, in the case of a member's  listing, a method of payment. You may also give personal data to us at other times,  such as when registering on the Site or when submitting an advertisement for a property. We  may also gather information from cookies or web beacons. You can find out more about they  operate in the relevant section of this policy below. We also collect IP  addresses, mobile device identifier details, your location, navigation and  click-stream data, the time of accessing the website, homes you viewed, what you  searched for, the duration of your visit, and other details of your  activity on the Site. If you ask us to connect with other sites (for example if  you ask us to connect with your Facebook account) we may get information  that way too. In connection with electronic communications we facilitate through a Site,  we use electronic or manual checks to monitor such communications for  trust and security purposes. For further details on how we collect personal  data, see Surveys and Newsletters below. We obtain data from you  either by you inputting your personal details, by the automatic collection of information  about you as you use the Site, when we speak to you, or from third parties.  Third party information may include financial information which we use to  prevent and detect fraud, information from your mobile provider if you are  accessing the Site over a mobile device or information from a third  party such as a social media or travel opinions site where you have asked us to  share your data with them. </p>
  <h3>How we use  your personal data</h3>
    <p>Our primary  purpose in collecting your personal data is to provide you with the services  you request and those which we believe will optimize your use of the Site.  You agree that we may use your personal data for the following purposes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the services or to support your request;</li>
    <li>To contact you  from time to time with user or service updates;</li>
    <li>To send other  messages that help us provide our services on the Site;</li>
    <li>To assist people you have done (or have agreed to  do) business with. For example if you are an owner and a traveler  who has booked or inquired with you needs your details we may pass them on; if  you are a traveler and an owner you have booked with needs to contact you we  may give them your details; </li>
    <li>To customize, measure, report on and improve our services, content and  advertising;</li>
    <li>To promote services related to the Site or those of  the Match Property Direct group and/or our affiliates; </li>
    <li>To compare  information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties;</li>
    <li>To prevent, investigate or prosecute activity we think  may be potentially illegal, unlawful or harmful and </li>
    <li>To enforce our Privacy Policy and/or our Terms or  any other purpose referenced herein or therein. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We collate  statistics about site traffic, sales and other commercial information which we  pass onto third parties to assist us in improving the services we provide to  you. We also use demographic information to tailor the Site and we share that information  with third parties so that they can build up a better picture of our  customer base and general consumer trends.</p>

    <p>If you are a member, we may also display your phone number on the listing  itself so that buyers and guests may contact you and to restrict  fraudulent behavior. We may also contact you about your account  and your use of our services. </p>

    <h3>How We May  Disclose Your Personal Data</h3>
   <p> We may  disclose your personal data to enforce our policies, or where we are permitted  to do so by applicable law, such as in response to a request by a law enforcement  or governmental authority, or in connection with actual or proposed litigation, or to  protect our property, people and other rights or interests.</p>
    <p>We may also share your personal data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One of our partners if you've requested their services or if you've  requested to be provided with information by them;</li>
    <li>Another member  if you have done business with them;</li>
    <li>A third party performing services on our behalf;</li>
    <li>Companies in the Match Property Direct group and/or  affiliates; or</li>
    <li>Other companies or business entities, for example if  we are thinking of a merger with or sale to that company or  business entity; </li>
    <li>Other companies we work with to feature all or part  of our member's property listings or otherwise provide  promotional or other services related to our or Match Property Direct group's business.  This might include featuring your listings and photographs on other websites; </li>
    <li>Any third party you have asked us to share your  personal data with - such as Facebook if you have asked us to connect  with your Facebook account; or </li>
    <li>Any legal or governmental entity pursuant to a subpoena or other legal  request.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may have  accessed our website through a hyperlink from the website of one of our trading  partners. If so, you consent to your personal details and purchase  information, including behavioral patterns, being shared with that trading  partner in accordance with our contractual relationship with them. </p>
   <p> In the  unlikely event that we or Match Property Direct, LLC. or  any part of the Matc hProperty Direct group is sold, or some of  its assets transferred to a third party, your personal information, as a valuable  asset, may also be transferred. Potential purchasers and their advisors may  have access to data as part of the sale process. However, use of your personal  information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy. Similarly, your  personal information may be passed on to a successor in interest in  the unlikely event of a liquidation, bankruptcy, or administration. Our  customer database could be sold separately from the rest of the business, in whole  or in a number of parts. It could be that the purchaser's business is  different from ours, too. </p>
    <h3>Newsletters</h3>
    <p>
    If you sign up as a  member on the Site, you may receive our Owner newsletter, which is an integral part  of the services we provide. Traveler users of the Site will be given the option  to receive our Traveler newsletter when they register with us. We and the  Pr-opertiMatch group may offer different newsletters from time to time  intended to enhance the services we or they offer. Users may  cancel their subscription to these newsletters at any time, although it may  take a short while for the changes in your preferences to become effective. </p>
    <h3>Surveys</h3>
  
  <p>We also use survey to collect completely  yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our services. </p>
  <h3>Games</h3>
  <p>From time to  time we may provide games on the Site. These games may allow for connectivity with other  users or third parties. If that is the case you consent to your personal data  being transferred accordingly. </p>

    <h3>Mobile Applications</h3>
    <p>When you  download or use apps relating to our websites, we may receive information about  your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your  device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based  services, such as advertising, search results, and other  personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.  If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we  recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer. </p>

    <h3>Telephone Calls</h3>
    <p>As well as  collecting data online and from correspondence we may also speak with you face  to face (for example at an Owner's meeting) or by telephone. We frequently  record telephone conversations. This Privacy Policy also governs those  recordings and we keep this data in the same way that we keep  other data. Recordings of calls may also be transferred to locations or processed  worldwide.</p>
    <h3>Inquiries and  other Electronic Communications</h3>
    <p>Buyers may  send inquiries to members via clickable links on the listings on a Site.  Further, buyers and members may communicate with each other via tools on a Site.  If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal  information, including your email address and any other  information you supply (unless the Site specifies otherwise), will be visible  to the member in question so that they might reply directly to you. Your details may  also be sent to us and we have access to those communications even if you  contact the member directly. If members and buyers further engage in  communications through a Site, we also have access to those communications,  which we monitor for trust and security purposes. Additionally those inquiries and messages  may be hosted on, be processed by or transmit through our servers. If you  engage in such communications and call the other party, you may be asked to  leave a return telephone number. Do not share  information in the e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to allow such person  and Match Property Direct group to have, including, but not limited to, credit  card and bank account information. In addition inquiries and messages can be sent to  the individual member you selected and to our system. Our customer  service team may share such communications with members. We  may also from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track  receipt of such communications, and analyze the pattern of such communications  for trust and security purposes as well as to gather data, such as inquiry and  booking data (on an anonymous basis), to assist us in better  understanding our business. </p>
    <h3>How Do We  Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?</h3>
    <p>We take  reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized  or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or  destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is  completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by the Site  reduce our vulnerability to security problems to a level appropriate to the type of  data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user database  and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains  your responsibility: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To protect  against unauthorized access to your use of the Site;</li>
    <li>To ensure no-one else uses the Site while your  machine is logged on to the Site (including by logging on to your  machine through a mobile, Wi-Fi or shared access connection you are using); </li>
    <li>To log off or exit from the Site when not using it;</li>
    <li>Where relevant, to keep your password or other  access information secret. Your password and log in details are  personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access  for example over a network; and </li>
    <li>To maintain good internet security. For example if  your email account or Facebook account is compromised this  could allow access to your account with us if you have given us those details and/or  permitted access through those accounts. If your email account is compromised  it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your  account with us. You should keep all of your account details secure. If you  think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should  change your account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any  compromised account does not allow access to your account with us. You should  also tell us as soon as you can, so that we can try to help you keep your account  secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have  asked us to share data with third party sites, however (such as Facebook) their  servers may not be secure. Credit card information is generally stored by  our credit card processing partners and we ask them to keep that data secure. We also use  third parties to help us optimize our website flow, content and advertising  (see below). Note that,  despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we engage, the Internet  is not secure. As a result others may nevertheless unlawfully intercept or  access private transmissions or data. </p>

    <h3>What are Cookies, Web  Beacons and Clear GIFs and Why Do We Use Them?</h3>
    <p>
    A  &quot;cookie&quot; is a small file placed on your hard drive by some of our web  pages. We, or third parties we do business with, may use cookies to help  us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and  advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety.  Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same  way we use them here at our Site. </p>
    <p>
    You may  delete and block all cookies from this site, but parts of the site will not  work. We want to be open about our cookie use. Even if you are only browsing  the Site certain information (including computer and connection information,  browser type and version, operating system and platform details, and the time  of accessing the Site) is automatically collected about you. This  information will be collected every time you access the Site and it will be used  for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>
    You can reduce  the information cookies collect from your device. An easy way of doing this is  often to change the settings in your browser. If you do that you should know  that (a) your use of the Site may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely  prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use  cookies to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and  (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you  use our and other, sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser  at this site: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>. Unless you  have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse  cookies, our system will send cookies as soon as you visit our site. By using the site you  consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.</p>
    <p>
    We gather and  share information concerning the use of the Site by members and buyers with one  or more third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics.  To do this, some of the pages you visit on our Site use electronic  images placed in the web page code, called pixel tags (also called  &quot;clear GIFs&quot; or &quot;web beacons&quot;) that can serve many of the  same purposes as cookies. </p>
    <p>
    Web beacons  may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to another in  order to maximize web traffic flow. Our third-party advertising service  providers may also use web beacons to recognize you when you visit the Site and  to help determine how you found the Site. If you would like more  information about this and to know your choices about not having this information  used by these companies, click here: <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a></p>

    <h3>Phishing or False emails</h3>
    <p>
    If you receive  an unsolicited email that appears to be from us or one of our members that requests  personal information (such as your credit card, login, or password), or that  asks you to verify or confirm your account or other personal information by clicking  on a link, that email was likely to have been sent by someone trying to  unlawfully obtain your information, sometimes referred to as  a &quot;phisher&quot; or &quot;spoofer.&quot; We do not ask for this type of  information in an email. Do not provide the information or click on the link. Please  contact us at <u>Customer  Support</u> if you get an email like this. </p>

    <h3>How do I correct or update my  information?</h3>
<p>
    You can see  any personal information processed by us. The best way of seeing this if you  are a property owner is to log on to your account by using the 'Owner Login'  tab at the top of the screen. You can see your basic details and correct  or update them there at any time to suit you. Clients can ask to see  any information we have on file for the user you by contacting us by email at <a href="mailto:support@matchpropertydirect.com">support@MatchPropertyDirect.com</a> and we have  72 hours to respond. </p>

    <h3>How do I opt-out of receiving  marketing communications from you?</h3>
    <p>
    We will  contact you from time to time for marketing purposes. Unless you have opted  out, this could include contacting you by phone or email. <br>
    You may  opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by the following means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact us at <u>matchpropertydirect@gmail.com</u></li>
    <li>Follow the instructions included in each communication or newsletter;</li>
    <li>Use the Unsubscribe function; or</li>
    <li>Mail the request to us at PO Box 2761 Palm Beach FL 33480</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please  remember that if you change your preferences it may take a short time for those  preferences to become effective. </p>

    <h3>How long will we keep your personal data?</h3>
    <p>
    Client personal  data only as long as is necessary for the purposes to which you consent under  the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>If you have  any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this Site, or your  dealings with this Site, we encourage you to contact us at 1-833-628-2473 or  matchpropertydirect@gmail.com </p>

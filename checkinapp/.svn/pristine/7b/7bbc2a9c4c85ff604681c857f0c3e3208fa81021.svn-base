Card in the amount of $1 per $1 of pending charge.&nbsp; You also authorize Modern Round to charge your Payment Card for any other charges you may incur associated with your Monthly Membership, if applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. PAYMENT </p>
<p>a. MONTHLY BILLING</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">FEES RELATING TO YOUR PAYMENT CARD.&nbsp; You are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to your Payment Card by the issuer, bank or financial institution including, but not limited to, membership, overdraft, insufficient funds and over the credit limit fees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">EXPIRATION DATE AND REFUSAL OF CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT CARD.&nbsp; If your Payment Card reaches its expiration date, your failure to cancel your Monthly Membership constitutes authorization for Modern Round to continue billing that Payment Card.&nbsp; If your Payment Card for any reason will not accept charges for any periodic Monthly Membership Fee, your Monthly Membership will be immediately suspended until payment is collected.&nbsp; For the 60 days immediately following the suspension day, Modern Round may attempt to charge the Payment Card the periodic Monthly Membership Fee every 10 days.&nbsp; If the charge is accepted, then your Monthly Membership benefits will be reinstated as of the date the charge is accepted.&nbsp; In order for your membership to be reinstated, you must make your Payment Card information valid by either rectifying the issue with the Payment Card issuer or providing new Payment Card information by contacting your membership department.&nbsp; If Modern Round is able to charge your Payment Card (existing or new, if you have provided new Payment Card information) and any past due Modern Round membership fees are paid, then your Monthly Membership benefits will continue uninterrupted and this Payment Card will be used to charge the applicable periodic membership fee for each consecutive renewal period until your Monthly Membership is cancelled (your original anniversary date will still apply) and will be your Payment Card for all purposes. If Modern Round is unable to charge your Payment Card (existing or new) for 3 consecutive billing dates, your Monthly Membership will be terminated and you will not be able to use your membership or any associated perks at any Modern Round location. If Modern Round terminates your membership, you must immediately surrender your membership card and you will remain liable for all unpaid dues (including any Monthly Membership charges and all other charges against your account).&nbsp; If your membership is terminated by Modern Round, you will not receive a refund on any amounts paid under any type of membership.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-top:6.0pt;text-align:justify">From time to time, Modern Round may avail itself of account updating services provided by the Payment Card industry, including, without limitation, VISA’s Account Updater program or MasterCard’s Automatic Billing Updater program.&nbsp; By enrolling in a Monthly Membership, you hereby agree and authorize Modern Round to update your Payment Card or similar account information and charge any updated Payment Card in accordance with the terms and conditions of such account updating programs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">SERVICE CHARGES: You agree to pay a $20.00 charge (plus applicable taxes) for all rejected payments, whether by Payment Card, or Pre-Authorized/credit card auto debit system. Any arrears of dues owed to Modern Round will bear interest at 18% per annum (subject to applicable usury laws).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">b. ANNUAL PAYMENT</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Members have the option of paying for the entire 12-month initial term (rather than monthly billing) upon signing this agreement, and will pay their 12 month term and initiation fee in full by corporate check, VISA<sup>&reg;</sup>, MASTERCARD<sup>&reg;</sup>, or AMERICAN EXPRESS<sup>&reg;</sup> credit card or VISA or MASTERCARD check card (check card must bear the VISA or MASTERCARD logo).&nbsp; Upon the completion of the initial 12-month term, Member may choose to provide payment as stated in sections 3 and 4a for monthly billing, or remit payment in full for an additional 12 month term.&nbsp; Payments made to Modern Round for Monthly Membership are non-refundable.</p>

MEMBERSHIP FREEZE: Modern Round offers Platinum and Platinum Hero Members the ability to temporarily suspend, or “freeze,” their Monthly Membership when they know in advance they will not be using any Modern Round for an extended period.&nbsp; A Platinum or Platinum Hero Membership may be placed on freeze with a 30-day written notice from a Member to Modern Round.&nbsp; Months on freeze do not apply toward the Member’s 12 month initial term.&nbsp; During the freeze period, Members will be charged $50 per month, plus applicable tax, and are not permitted to use their Monthly Membership at any Modern Round location.&nbsp; Freeze fee is not applicable toward Modern Round or cancellation fee and is non-refundable.&nbsp; Members may still visit a Modern Round on a purchase-per-visit basis; Monthly Membership perks will not apply on these visits.&nbsp; A membership freeze cannot begin prior to Modern Round receiving written notice from the Member stating his/her intent to freeze and the intended duration of the freeze; an end-freeze date is required at the time of the request.&nbsp; This request can be submitted to your Membership Director.&nbsp; Corporate Platinum Memberships are not eligible for freeze.</p>

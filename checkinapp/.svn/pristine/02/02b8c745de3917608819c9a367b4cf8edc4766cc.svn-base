Card in the amount of $1 per $1 of pending charge.&nbsp; You also authorize Modern Round to charge your Payment Card for any other charges you may incur associated with your Monthly Membership, if applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. PAYMENT </p>
<p>a. MONTHLY BILLING</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">FEES RELATING TO YOUR PAYMENT CARD.&nbsp; You are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to your Payment Card by the issuer, bank or financial institution including, but not limited to, membership, overdraft, insufficient funds and over the credit limit fees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">EXPIRATION DATE AND REFUSAL OF CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT CARD.&nbsp; If your Payment Card reaches its expiration date, your failure to cancel your Monthly Membership constitutes authorization for Modern Round to continue billing that Payment Card.&nbsp; If your Payment Card for any reason will not accept charges for any periodic Monthly Membership Fee, your Monthly Membership will be immediately suspended until payment is collected.&nbsp; For the 60 days immediately following the suspension day, Modern Round may attempt to charge the Payment Card the periodic Monthly Membership Fee every 10 days.&nbsp; If the charge is accepted, then your Monthly Membership benefits will be reinstated as of the date the charge is accepted.&nbsp; In order for your membership to be reinstated, you must make your Payment Card information valid by either rectifying the issue with the Payment Card issuer or providing new Payment Card information by contacting your membership department.&nbsp; If Modern Round is able to charge your Payment Card (existing or new, if you have provided new Payment Card information) and any past due Modern Round membership fees are paid, then your Monthly Membership benefits will continue uninterrupted and this Payment Card will be used to charge the applicable periodic membership fee for each consecutive renewal period until your Monthly Membership is cancelled (your original anniversary date will still apply) and will be your Payment Card for all purposes. If Modern Round is unable to charge your Payment Card (existing or new) for 3 consecutive billing dates, your Monthly Membership will be terminated and you will not be able to use your membership or any associated perks at any Modern Round location. If Modern Round terminates your membership, you must immediately surrender your membership card and you will remain liable for all unpaid dues (including any Monthly Membership charges and all other charges against your account).&nbsp; If your membership is terminated by Modern Round, you will not receive a refund on any amounts paid under any type of membership.&nbsp; </p>
